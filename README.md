# py_ideal_gas_cal
Use ideal gas law to calculate PV=nRT, specific heat capacity of constant volume, heat capasity of constant pressure, gamma (the adiabatic index also known as the isentropic expansion factor (c_p / c_v)) and speed of sound in the gas.
For gas specific constant calculation, 3 methods can be choose:
1) General
2) Using Boltzmann constant
3) Use Mayer's relation
